# 👋 Hey, I'm Drexira

I'm a **self-taught programmer** who mainly works on **mods, tools, and game-related projects**.
Started out tinkering with small scripts, now I do things like custom mods for **SPT** and **Minecraft**, and random Unity projects.

## 🎮 Projects & Interests
- **Game Modding** → SPT, Minecraft, and whatever else catches my attention
- **Unity Stuff** → prototypes, tools, and experiments
- **Custom Scripts** → little utilities that make things easier or just fun to mess with

---

## 🌱 Currently
- Learning more about **low-level game systems** (AI, networking, inventory logic)
- Expanding mods beyond “just tweaks” into **bigger gameplay additions**
- Slowly building a base of **reusable tools** for future projects

---

## 💡 Random Facts
- I learn by doing → break it, fix it, repeat.
- Usually juggling multiple ideas at once.
- Big fan of experimenting with weird mechanics and seeing what happens.
